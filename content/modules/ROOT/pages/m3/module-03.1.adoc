== Activity: Platform Engineer workflow

The {rhcl} operator has been already setup amongst a few other components. 


== Explore the workshop setup

. Navigate to the {rhcl} plugin link from the bottom of the left-hand navigation
+
image:m3/rhcl-console-view.png[] 
. In the Overview section of {ocp_cluster_openshift_cluster_console_url}/kuadrant/overview[Connectivity Link^, window="console"] plugin menu, you can view the  `prod-web` Gateway and the preconfigured TLS Policy.
+
image:m3/gateway-tls-view.png[]
. This Gateway (based on Istio Gateway) has been created with a wildcard hostname `*.travels.{ocp_cluster_openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}`, and a TLS Policy has already been created. 
. If you access the `prod-web` Gateway by clicking on it, the  *YAML* tab will display the Gateway details
+
[source,sh,subs=attributes+]
----
spec:
  gatewayClassName: istio
  listeners:
    - allowedRoutes:
        namespaces:
          from: All
      hostname: '*.travels.{ocp_cluster_workshop_main_domain}' <1>
      name: api
      port: 443
      protocol: HTTPS
      tls:
        certificateRefs: <2>
          - group: ''
            kind: Secret
            name: api-tls 
        mode: Terminate
----
+
<1> This is the wildcarded hostname which will handle all traffic routed through the `travels.{ocp_cluster_workshop_main_domain}` domain
<2> The TLS Policy that has been pre-created leverages the a TLS-issuer set up TLS certificates for the listeners defined within the Gateway.


== Setup policies for the Gateway

=== Create a DNSPolicy

. Click the *(+)* button on the top navigation bar of {ocp_cluster_openshift_cluster_console_url}[Openshift Console^, window="console"] to create a new resource.
. In the YAML editor, copy the following *DNSPolicy* CR
+
[source,sh,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
apiVersion: kuadrant.io/v1
kind: DNSPolicy
metadata:
  name: prod-web-dnspolicy
  namespace: ingress-gateway
spec:
  targetRef:
    name: prod-web
    group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
    kind: Gateway
  providerRefs:
  - name: prod-web-aws-credentials
----
. Scroll to the bottom of the page to note that the DNSPolicy has been accepted and enforced
+
image:m3/gw-dns-policy-created.png[]
+
NOTE: The Message displayed against the `Enforced` is to notfy that there are no HTTPRroutes attached yet. This will change once a developer creates a HTTPRroute

[%collapsible]
====

* DNS Policies can be created with more complex configurations as well, including default Geo Code, load balancing options - especially in a hybrid cloud setup.
* "load balanced" means we configure the DNS provider to return different gateway/loadbalancer addresses to queries from DNS clients based on specific weighting and geo location configuration. 
* E.g. you can define a default `GEO-EU` 
+
```yaml
  loadBalancing:
    weight: 120 
    geo: GEO-EU 
    defaultGeo: true
```
* This allows of location-aware routing of requests. With the right configuration, requests from US can be routed to a Gateway (CR) setup in a US cluster and all other requests can be routed to a default `GEO-EU` cluster
* Learn more https://docs.kuadrant.io/1.0.x/kuadrant-operator/doc/user-guides/dns/load-balanced-dns/[here, window="content"]

=== Create a zero-trust AuthPolicy

As a Platform Engineer, you will now setup an AuthPolicy for tailor-made Zero Trust API security.

. In the YAML editor, copy the following AuthPolicy CR
+
[source,sh,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
apiVersion: kuadrant.io/v1
kind: AuthPolicy
metadata:
  name: prod-web-deny-all
  namespace: ingress-gateway
spec:
  targetRef:
    group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
    kind: Gateway
    name: prod-web
  rules:
    authorization:
      deny-all:
        opa:
          rego: "allow = false"
    response:
      unauthorized:
        headers:
          "content-type":
            value: application/json
        body:
          value: |
            {
              "error": "Forbidden",
              "message": "Access denied by default by the gateway operator. If you are the administrator of the service, create a specific auth policy for the route."
            }

----
. This policy denies all incoming requests, and sends a custom error message as part of the response.
. Click the Create button at the bottom of the YAML editor
+
image:m3/gw-auth-create-yaml.png[] 
. Scroll to the bottom of the DNSPolicy details page to note that the DNSPolicy has been accepted but not enforced
+
image:m3/gw-rlp-created.png[] 
. The AuthPolicy is not enforced because there are not HTTPRoutes (yet) on which to enforce this policy. This will change once a Developer creates a `HTTPRoute`


=== Create a default low-limit RateLimitPolicy

. In the YAML editor, copy the following AuthPolicy CR and save
+
[source,sh,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
apiVersion: kuadrant.io/v1
kind: RateLimitPolicy
metadata:
  name: ingress-gateway-rlp-lowlimits
spec:
  targetRef:
    group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
    kind: Gateway
    name: prod-web
  limits:
    "default-limits":
      rates:
      - limit: 5
        window: 10s
----
. Click the Create button at the bottom of the YAML editor
+
image:m3/gw-rlp-yaml.png[] 
. Scroll to the bottom of the RateLimitPolicy details page to note that the RateLimitPolicy has been accepted but not enforced
+
image:m3/gw-rlp-created.png[]
. The RateLimitPolicy is not enforced because there are not HTTPRoutes (yet) on which to enforce this policy. This will change once a Developer creates a `HTTPRoute`


== Test the setup so far

Let us create a simple HTTPRoute to test the setup so far, to ensure all requests are denied due to the zero trust policy we have setup

. In the YAML editor, copy the following HTTPRoute CR and save
+
[source,sh,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: echo-api
  namespace: echo-api
  labels:
    deployment: echo-api
    service: echo-api
spec:
  parentRefs:
    - name: prod-web
      namespace: ingress-gateway
  hostnames:
    - echo.travels.{ocp_cluster_workshop_main_domain}
  rules:
    - backendRefs:
        - name: echo-api
          port: 8080
          namespace: echo-api
----
. In the terminal run the following command
+
[source,sh,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
curl -k -w "%{http_code}" https://echo.travels.{ocp_cluster_workshop_main_domain}
----
. This should display an error message. You may note that this the same response as configured in the Gateway
+
```yaml
{
  "error": "Forbidden",
  "message": "Access denied by default by the gateway operator. If you are the administrator of the service, create a specific auth policy for the route."
}
```
+
[WARNING] 
====
* There is a possibility that you might face such an error `curl: (6) Could not resolve host: echo.travels.sandbo123.opentlc.com`
* This is because the DNS resolution may take a few minutes. 
* You can retry in a minute or two.
