== Module 2: Secure microservices access control with {rhossm}

== Canary Rollout

=== Set Kiali Display Options

To ensure we can monitor the canary rollout, let's make sure we can observe the necessary display options in our Kiali Traffic Graph

Navigate to the Kiali console in a new tab:

* http://kiali-istio-system.{ocp_cluster_openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}[Link to Kiali console, window="kiali"] 

Make sure you have the following options set in the Kiali *Traffic Graph* tab section:

*Top Menu*

. Namespace: `travel-agency`
. Replay `Last 1m` `Every 10s` - To display the most up-to-date data

*Display Options*

. Traffic Distribution - To display traffic distribution between `v1` and `v2`
. Idle Nodes - Will display our `v2` deployment
. Traffic Animation - Informational traffic flow animation


=== Step 3: Run a Canary Rollout Script

Now you’ll run a simple Bash script to gradually shift traffic from `v1` to `v2` in stages: 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and finally 100%. The script patches the `VirtualService` on the fly, and you’ll observe the results in real time via Kiali, as well as from logs in the terminal window.

[NOTE]
====
In this lab, we are using a simple Bash script to perform a canary rollout for illustrative and educational purposes. This helps demonstrate how traffic shifting works in OpenShift Service Mesh in a straightforward, hands-on way.

In a real-world production environment, organizations typically use a progressive delivery tool like **Argo Rollouts**, which provides advanced deployment strategies such as canary, blue-green, and automated analysis. Argo Rollouts is included as part of **OpenShift Container Platform**.

* In the upper terminal, run the log monitoring script:

+
[source,sh,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
sh <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/app-connectivity-workshop/workshop-devspaces/main/workshop/m2/canary-monitoring.sh)
----

You should immediatly start seeing log output from discounts-v1 `[discounts/v1]`.

* In the lower terminal, run the canary-rollout script:

+
[source,sh,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
sh <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/app-connectivity-workshop/workshop-devspaces/main/workshop/m2/canary-rollout.sh)
----

This will start updating the weights in the VirtualService every 20 seconds.

Once the rollout begins, you will see logs in the upper terminal for discount-v2 `[discount/v2]` gradually increase, while log messages from discount-v1 `[discount/v1]` decrease.

Expected final output:

```bash
Begin Canary Rollout...
100% traffic routed to v1, 0% to v2
virtualservice.networking.istio.io/discounts patched
90% traffic routed to v1, 10% to v2
virtualservice.networking.istio.io/discounts patched
75% traffic routed to v1, 25% to v2
virtualservice.networking.istio.io/discounts patched
50% traffic routed to v1, 50% to v2
virtualservice.networking.istio.io/discounts patched
25% traffic routed to v1, 75% to v2
virtualservice.networking.istio.io/discounts patched
0% traffic routed to v1, 100% to v2
```

=== Step 4: Observe traffic changes with Kiali

As the script progresses, switch to the *Kiali console* and open the *Traffic Graph* for the `travel-agency` namespace.

TIP: Set the refresh rate to *10s* and the time window to *Last 1m* to clearly observe traffic shifting between service versions.

Although Kiali will lag behind by 1 minute, you’ll begin to see more and more requests routed to the `discounts-v2` pod as the script progresses.

And finally

=== Cleanup/Reset (Optional)

If you'd like to reset traffic routing back to 100% to `v1`, you can reapply the above `VirtualService` manifest or run a patch manually in the bottom terminal window.

+
[source,sh,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
oc -n travel-agency patch virtualservice discounts --type=json -p='[
  {"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/http/0/route/0/weight", "value": 100},
  {"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/http/0/route/1/weight", "value": 0}
]'
----

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the log output in the upper terminal window.


=== Summary:

You’ve just performed a progressive rollout of a new version of a microservice using weighted routing in OpenShift Service Mesh. This powerful technique enables you to test updates incrementally, observe behavior, and reduce the risk of pushing changes to production.
Congradulations on completing "Secure microservices access control with {rhossm}" !!!

=== End of Module Summary

In this module, we explored how {corp} can use {rhossm} to address the growing complexity of managing microservices. By adopting a consistent, code-free approach to observability, traffic control, and security, {corp} is better positioned to scale its applications while reducing operational risk.

Through hands-on activities, we:

* Configured core components of {rhossm} to gain visibility and control over service communication.

* Implemented a zero trust security model by applying an AuthorizationPolicy to restrict service access based on need.

* Used advanced traffic management techniques, such as canary rollouts, to safely deploy new service versions.

These capabilities empower {corp} to innovate faster, deploy with confidence, and maintain high standards of security and reliability across its application landscape.
