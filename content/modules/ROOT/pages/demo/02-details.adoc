* "Start at the end" describing the solution to the problem

**Technical Demo (10-15 minutes):**

* Follow the guide and demo the solution.
* Focus on automation and business velocity, not just technical features.
* Each part has a **Know** and most parts have a **Show** section.

**Closing (5-10+ minutes):**

* Repeat the problem and emphasize how the solution solved that problem
* Move from the imaginary problem to the customer's real problem
* Save time for questions and interationss!
