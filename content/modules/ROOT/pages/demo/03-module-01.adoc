= Demo Module 01: Understanding the Know/Show Structure
:source-highlighter: rouge
:toc: macro
:toclevels: 1

This module demonstrates how to structure a good demo using the **Know** and **Show** sections. We'll use examples from the showroom-rhads content to illustrate best practices.

== Part 1 — The Know/Show Structure Explained

=== Know
_The Know/Show structure is the foundation of effective demo delivery. It separates what the presenter needs to understand from what they need to demonstrate._

**Why This Structure Works:**

* **Know sections** provide context, business value, and background information
* **Show sections** give step-by-step instructions for the actual demonstration
* This separation helps presenters understand the "why" before the "how"
* It ensures demos focus on business value rather than just technical features

**Example from a well-structured demo:**
In an OpenShift demo, the Know section explains the customer's business challenge (6-8 week deployment cycles) before showing how to deploy an application using `oc new-app`. This helps presenters understand the business impact.

=== Show
* Review a well-structured demo as a reference:
  * Notice how each module follows the Know/Show pattern
  * See how business context is established before technical steps
  * Observe the flow from problem to solution

* Examine the Know section in a typical module:
  * Look at the business challenge setup
  * Notice the specific metrics (6-8 weeks → 5 minutes)
  * See how customer pain points are clearly articulated

== Part 2 — Business Context in Know Sections

=== Know
_Good Know sections don't just list technical features — they tell a story that resonates with the customer's business challenges._

**Elements of an Effective Know Section:**

* **Business Challenge:** What problem is the customer facing?
* **Current State:** How bad is it now? (use specific metrics)
* **Desired State:** What would success look like?
* **Business Value:** Quantified benefits and outcomes
* **Stakeholder Impact:** Who cares and why?

**Real Example from a well-structured demo:**
The overview page establishes a retail company's e-commerce platform challenge: "update the checkout service in 4 weeks for Black Friday" with current 10-week cycles. This creates urgency and relevance.

=== Show
* Study a well-structured demo overview as a reference:
  * Notice the specific company scenario
  * See the time constraint (4 weeks for Black Friday)
  * Identify the current pain (10-week cycles)

* Practice with OpenShift examples:
  * Show how `oc new-app` reduces deployment time
  * Demonstrate automatic scaling with `oc autoscale`
  * Highlight the business value of self-service deployment

* Review the Problem section:
  * Count the specific pain points listed
  * Notice how each point relates to business impact
  * See the connection between technical issues and business outcomes

== Part 3 — Technical Steps in Show Sections

=== Know
_Show sections should be clear, actionable, and focused on what the presenter needs to do, not what they need to understand._

**Characteristics of Good Show Sections:**

* **Step-by-step instructions** with clear numbering
* **Screenshots and images** to guide the presenter
* **Specific commands and inputs** that can be copied
* **Expected outcomes** for each step
* **Troubleshooting hints** for common issues

**Example from a well-structured demo:**
A typical module's Show section provides exact field values, button names, and expected screens, making it easy for presenters to follow along without guessing.

=== Show
* Study a well-structured demo's Show section:
* Notice the specific field values provided:
  * Application Name: `my-nodejs-app`
  * Git Repository: `https://github.com/example/nodejs-ex`
  * Image Stream: `nodejs:18`

* Look at the image references:
  * Each step has a corresponding screenshot
  * Images are numbered sequentially (step-1.png, step-2.png)
  * Screenshots show exactly what the presenter should see

* Example of image formatting from showroom-rhads:
+
[source,asciidoc]
----
image::tekton-dev-1.png[align="center",width=500]
----

* Tips for effective images:
  * Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `oc-new-app-1.png`, `ansible-playbook-1.png`)
  * Set appropriate width (usually 500-800 pixels)
  * Center align for better presentation
  * Include alt text for accessibility

* Examine the command examples:
  * Git commands are in code blocks
  * Username/password placeholders use consistent formatting
  * Expected outputs are clearly indicated

* Practice with Ansible examples:
  * Show how `ansible-playbook` automates configuration
  * Demonstrate idempotent operations with `--check` mode
  * Highlight the business value of infrastructure as code

== Part 4 — Connecting Know and Show

=== Know
_The best demos seamlessly connect the business context (Know) with the technical demonstration (Show), making the value proposition clear throughout._

**How to Connect Know and Show:**

* **Reference the business challenge** during technical steps
* **Highlight how each step solves** the identified problem
* **Use consistent language** between Know and Show sections
* **Provide context reminders** at key demonstration points

**Example from a well-structured demo:**
The module continuously references "the customer's transformation" and "business value" while showing technical steps. For instance, when demonstrating `oc new-app`, explain how this single command eliminates weeks of manual deployment work.

=== Show
* Review how the showroom-rhads modules maintain business focus:
  * Look for business language in technical sections
  * Notice how metrics are referenced during demonstrations
  * See how customer benefits are reinforced

* Practice connecting Know and Show:
  * Take a technical step like `oc new-app` or `ansible-playbook`
  * Rewrite it to include business context
  * Ensure the connection is clear and natural

* Example: Instead of just showing `oc new-app`, say:
  "This single command eliminates the 3-5 business days your team currently spends waiting for platform setup, giving developers immediate access to deploy their applications."

* Adding tip notes to your demo:

[NOTE]
====
**Pro Tip:** Always connect technical commands to business value. 
Instead of "This command creates a pod," say "This command creates a pod, 
eliminating the need for manual container orchestration."

[TIP]
====
**Best Practice:** Use the Know/Show structure consistently. 
Each technical step should have a corresponding business context.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
**Key Point:** Business value should be mentioned in every Show section. 
Don't just demonstrate features—explain why they matter.
====

== Key Takeaways

* **Know sections** provide business context and understanding
* **Show sections** give clear, actionable technical steps
* **Connection between them** maintains business focus throughout
* **Specific examples and metrics** make the demo compelling
* **Consistent structure** helps presenters deliver effectively

This Know/Show structure transforms technical demonstrations into compelling business stories that resonate with customers and drive value.
