== Part 1 — Set the Stage

=== Know
_ACME's checkout service team faced slow delivery cycles and security bottlenecks. RHADS transforms this into minutes-not-weeks delivery with enterprise security built-in._

**Business Challenge:**
Creating a new checkout service requires:

* 3-5 business days waiting for platform team to set up repositories  
* 1-2 weeks coordinating security requirements across teams
* Multiple handoffs between development, platform, and security teams
* High risk of configuration errors and security gaps

**Technical Solution:**
* **Zero Waiting:** Instant GitLab repos and secure CI/CD pipelines
* **Zero Coordination:** Security and compliance are automatically configured  
* **Zero Errors:** Standardized templates eliminate configuration mistakes
* **Zero Platform Overhead:** Developers self-serve without platform team involvement

== Part 2 — Scaffold a New Application in Red Hat Developer Hub

=== Know
_ACME's transformation starts here — one developer action eliminates weeks of setup and coordination overhead._
