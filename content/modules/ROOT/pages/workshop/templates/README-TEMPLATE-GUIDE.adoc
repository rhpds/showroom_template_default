This guide explains how to use the workshop templates with storytelling techniques to create engaging, memorable learning experiences. Learn the formatting patterns for images, code blocks, showroom variables, and narrative elements that transform technical training into compelling professional journeys.

== Storytelling Framework

The workshop templates use a **personal protagonist approach** that transforms learners into the hero of their own professional journey. This creates emotional investment and makes complex technical concepts more accessible and memorable.

=== Core Narrative Elements

**Personal Stakes**: Position the learner as someone facing a real business crisis with personal and professional consequences.

**Emotional Journey Arc**: Guide learners through:
* Initial frustration with current processes
* Discovery moments when technology works as promised
* Progressive empowerment as skills develop
* Achievement satisfaction with successful implementations

**Internal Dialogue**: Include thought processes and emotional reactions throughout exercises to make the technical journey feel human and relatable.

**Second-Person Narrative**: Use "You" consistently rather than "participants" to create direct personal engagement.

== Template File Structure

The workshop templates follow this naming convention and storytelling progression:

* `00-index.adoc` - Workshop guide introduction and structure explanation
* `01-overview.adoc` - Crisis setup, personal stakes, and emotional engagement
* `02-details.adoc` - Technical requirements positioned as preparation for success
* `03-module-01.adoc` - First breakthrough moment and confidence building
* `04-module-02.adoc` - Building momentum and demonstrating real value
* `05-module-03.adoc` - Hero moment with production-ready capabilities

== Variable Substitution Patterns

=== Showroom Variables
Use double curly braces for showroom variable substitution:

[source,asciidoc]
----
= {{ Workshop Title }}
{{ Product | Solution }} does X to solve Y.
{{ Company }} needs to {{ business requirement }}.
----

=== Storytelling Template Placeholders
Use double curly braces for narrative placeholders that create engaging, personal experiences:

[source,asciidoc]
----

{{ old process duration }}          # Current slow timeframe
{{ new timeframe }}                 # Improved speed with solution
{{ avoided complexity }}            # Manual work eliminated

# Business Impact Variables
{{ transformation description }}    # How work changes
{{ visual of success }}             # Imagined positive outcome
{{ team impact }}                   # Effect on colleagues

== Image Asset Organization

Images should be placed in the `assets/images/` directory with descriptive names:

* `production-architecture.png` - Architecture diagrams
* `step1-deployment.png` - Sequential step screenshots
* `before-after-comparison.png` - Comparison images
* `monitoring-dashboard.png` - Interface screenshots
* `executive-dashboard.png` - Audience-specific views

Use consistent naming patterns that match your content structure.

== Best Practices

1. **Variable Consistency**: Use the same company name and scenario throughout
2. **Image Sizing**: Use width=600-700 for main diagrams, 250-300 for side-by-side
3. **Code Formatting**: Always specify language for syntax highlighting
4. **Step Numbering**: Use bullet points with descriptive text, not just numbers
5. **Verification Steps**: Include verification for each major step
6. **Business Context**: Always connect technical steps to business value
7. **Audience Adaptation**: Provide content alternatives for different technical levels
