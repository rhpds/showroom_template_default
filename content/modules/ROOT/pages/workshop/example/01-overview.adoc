== Your role and mission

You're a senior developer at ACME Corporation, and you've been assigned to evaluate containerization for an important client project.

ACME needs to improve deployment times for a key client contract. Your manager has explained: "We need to reduce deployment times significantly to meet client expectations and project timelines."

**Your assignment**: Evaluate containerization technology and determine if it can address ACME's deployment challenges within the project timeline.

**The objective**: Demonstrate whether containers can improve deployment speed and reliability for ACME's development workflow.

== Success criteria for your mission

By the end of this workshop, you'll have practical container skills to address ACME's deployment challenges:

* Create and manage container images using industry best practices → **ensure consistent deployments across environments**
* Deploy containerized applications to Red Hat OpenShift efficiently → **demonstrate significantly faster deployment times**
* Configure application networking and storage for production workloads → **meet client scalability requirements**
* Implement CI/CD workflows that reduce manual deployment steps → **improve development team efficiency**
* Troubleshoot common container deployment issues → **maintain reliable production systems**

**Technical outcome**: You'll have hands-on experience with container technology that directly applies to ACME's current challenges.

**Business benefit**: Proven deployment approach that reduces time-to-market and improves operational reliability.

== Target audience
This workshop is designed for:

* Software developers who want faster environment provisioning
* DevOps engineers looking to improve deployment consistency
* Technical professionals evaluating container adoption
* Anyone interested in hands-on container development experience

== What you need to succeed
You should have:

* Basic command line experience (Linux/Unix) - you've used a terminal before
* Understanding of web application concepts - you know what a web server does
* Access to a computer with internet connectivity
* Basic container knowledge and willingness to learn (no prior container experience required)

== ACME Corporation's deployment challenges

**The situation**: ACME Corporation needs to improve deployment efficiency for a client project with specific timeline requirements.

**Project timeline**: Evaluate containerization technology and provide recommendations within the current project cycle.

**Current challenges** (operational pain points):

* **Long provisioning times**: Environment setup takes 2 to 3 weeks → slows down development iterations and client deliveries
* **Environment inconsistencies**: Applications behave differently across dev, staging, and production → creates debugging overhead and deployment risk
* **Manual processes**: Deployment requires significant manual intervention → introduces human error and limits scalability
* **Complex configurations**: Each environment has unique setup requirements → increases maintenance overhead and onboarding time

**The opportunity**: Containerization technology can address these deployment challenges, and you've been selected to evaluate its feasibility for ACME's use case.

**Technical perspective**: "Container technology has proven benefits at other organizations, but I need to evaluate how it would work with our specific applications and infrastructure."

== Your vision of success

If containerization proves effective for ACME's use case, here's the potential technical improvements:

**Immediate improvements** (short-term):
* **Faster deployments**: Reduce deployment time from weeks to minutes → improve development velocity and client responsiveness
* **Environment consistency**: Eliminate environment-specific deployment issues → more predictable release cycles

**Strategic benefits** (longer-term):
* **Better resource utilization**: More efficient infrastructure usage → reduced operational costs
* **Automated scaling**: Applications can scale based on demand → improved performance during traffic spikes
* **Improved development workflow**: Developers can focus on features instead of deployment complexity → increased team productivity

**Success metric**: A demonstrable improvement in deployment speed and reliability that can be presented to stakeholders as a viable solution for ACME's operational challenges.

== Common questions

**"Can we containerize existing applications without major changes?"**
→ Yes. Module 2 demonstrates containerizing ACME's web application without modifying the application code

**"What about security considerations?"**
→ Module 3 covers security scanning, policies, and compliance features built into container platforms

**"How does this integrate with our current CI/CD pipeline?"**
→ Module 4 shows integration approaches with existing tools like Jenkins

**"Is container adoption sustainable for our team?"**
→ The workshop demonstrates practical skills and sustainable practices for ongoing container use
