You're a developer at ACME Corporation working on improving deployment processes for an important client project.

== Your objectives
By the end of this workshop, you'll have learned practical container skills and be able to:

* Create and manage container images using industry best practices
* Deploy containerized applications to Red Hat OpenShift in minutes, not weeks
* Configure application networking and storage in container environments
* Implement basic CI/CD workflows that eliminate deployment bottlenecks
* Troubleshoot common container deployment issues with confidence

== Target audience
This workshop is designed for:

* Software developers who want faster environment provisioning
* DevOps engineers looking to improve deployment consistency
* Technical professionals evaluating container adoption
* Anyone interested in hands-on container development experience

== What you need to succeed
You should have:

* Basic command line experience (Linux/Unix) - you've used a terminal before
* Understanding of web application concepts - you know what a web server does
* Access to a computer with internet connectivity
* The determination to solve ACME's deployment crisis (no prior container experience required)

== Workshop scenario
ACME Corporation has a client project with a 6-week deadline for three major feature updates. The current deployment process takes 2-3 weeks, which could cause delays.

You've been experiencing common deployment challenges:

* **Long provisioning times** for new environments
* **Environment inconsistencies** causing deployment failures
* **Manual processes** that are error-prone and time-consuming
* **Complex configurations** that are difficult to replicate

Your manager has asked you to evaluate containerization as a potential solution to improve deployment speed and consistency.

== Expected outcomes
Container adoption will help ACME achieve:

* **Faster deployments**: Reduce deployment time from 2-3 weeks to minutes
* **Environment consistency**: Identical deployments from development to production
* **Better resource utilization**: More efficient use of infrastructure
* **Automated scaling**: Applications that scale based on demand
* **Improved developer productivity**: Streamlined development and deployment workflows

== Common questions

**"Can we containerize existing applications without major changes?"**
→ Yes! Module 2 demonstrates containerizing ACME's web application without modifying the application code

**"What about security considerations?"**
→ Module 3 covers security scanning, policies, and compliance features built into container platforms

**"How does this integrate with our current CI/CD pipeline?"**
→ Module 4 shows integration approaches with existing tools like Jenkins

**"Is container adoption sustainable for our team?"**
→ The workshop demonstrates practical skills and sustainable practices for ongoing container use
