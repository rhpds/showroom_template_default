Learn container development fundamentals through hands-on practice with Red Hat OpenShift.

== Learning objectives
By the end of this workshop, participants will be able to:

* Create and manage container images using industry best practices
* Deploy containerized applications to Red Hat OpenShift
* Configure application networking and storage in container environments
* Implement basic CI/CD workflows for containerized applications
* Troubleshoot common container deployment issues

== Target audience
This workshop is designed for:

* Software developers new to container development
* DevOps engineers looking to improve container skills
* Technical professionals evaluating container adoption
* Anyone interested in hands-on container development experience

== Prerequisites
Participants should have:

* Basic command line experience (Linux/Unix)
* Understanding of web application concepts
* Access to a computer with internet connectivity
* No prior container experience required

== Workshop scenario
ACME Corporation is modernizing their application portfolio to improve deployment speed and operational efficiency.
Currently, their development teams spend 2-3 weeks deploying new application features due to complex server provisioning and configuration processes.

The goal is to reduce deployment time from weeks to minutes using containerization and modern deployment practices.
This workshop simulates ACME's transformation journey through practical exercises.

== Business value
Container adoption typically delivers:

* **Faster deployments**: From weeks to minutes for application updates
* **Improved consistency**: Identical environments from development to production
* **Resource efficiency**: Better server utilization and cost reduction
* **Enhanced scalability**: Automatic scaling based on application demand
* **Developer productivity**: Simplified development and testing workflows

== Common participant questions

**"How complex is container adoption for existing applications?"**
→ We'll demonstrate containerizing a traditional web application step-by-step (Module 2)

**"What about security and compliance in containerized environments?"**
→ Module 3 covers security scanning, policies, and compliance automation

**"How does this integrate with our existing CI/CD tools?"**
→ Module 4 shows integration with popular CI/CD platforms and practices

**"What's the learning curve for our development team?"**
→ The hands-on exercises demonstrate the developer experience and required skills
