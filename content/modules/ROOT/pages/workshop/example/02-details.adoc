* **Module 1**: Container fundamentals (45 minutes)
* **Module 2**: Application containerization (90 minutes)
* **Module 3**: Advanced deployment patterns (90 minutes)
* **Break time**: 15 minutes between modules

=== Abbreviated workshop (2 hours)
* **Module 1**: Container fundamentals (30 minutes)
* **Module 2**: Application containerization (60 minutes)
* **Module 3**: Basic deployment only (30 minutes)

== Technical requirements

=== Software versions
* Red Hat OpenShift 4.12 or later
* Podman 4.0 or later (or Docker 20.10+)
* Git 2.30 or later
* Web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

=== Environment access
Participants need access to:

* Red Hat OpenShift cluster (provided during workshop)
* Container registry access (Quay.io or Red Hat Registry)
* Terminal/command line environment
* Code editor (VS Code recommended)

=== Network requirements
* Internet connectivity for downloading container images
* Access to GitHub for sample applications
* OpenShift cluster network access (specific URLs provided)

== Environment setup

=== Pre-workshop checklist
□ **OpenShift cluster access confirmed** - Test login credentials
□ **Container runtime installed** - Verify Podman/Docker installation
□ **Git configured** - Set up user name and email
□ **Sample code downloaded** - Clone workshop repository
□ **Network connectivity verified** - Test access to required URLs

=== Setup validation
Participants should run these commands to verify setup:

```bash
# Verify container runtime
podman version

# Verify Git configuration
git config --list

# Verify OpenShift CLI
oc version

# Test cluster connectivity
oc whoami
```

== Troubleshooting guide

=== Common setup issues

**Problem**: "oc command not found"
→ **Solution**: Download OpenShift CLI from Red Hat Developer portal and add to PATH

**Problem**: "Permission denied" when running container commands
→ **Solution**: Add user to appropriate group (docker/podman) or use rootless containers

**Problem**: "Unable to connect to OpenShift cluster"
→ **Solution**: Verify network connectivity and login credentials

**Problem**: "Container image pull fails"
→ **Solution**: Check network connectivity and registry authentication

=== During workshop support
* Encourage participants to help each other
* Provide alternative approaches for different operating systems
* Have backup environments ready for technical difficulties
* Use screen sharing for complex troubleshooting
