== Presetup




== Activity: Setting up the site on RHEL
Similar to our OpenShift site, we will setup the site and routers on RHEL. We will using the Red Hat Service Interconnect command line interface to setup the site. 

We'll ssh into our on-prem RHEL machine using the Devspaces terminal. 

. Click on the https://devspaces.{ocp_cluster_openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}#/https://github.com/rpscodes/app_connectivity_summit25.git[Devspaces, window="devspaces"] link.

. Wait for the Dev Spaces workspace to initialize and come load. It usually takes a minute or two.

. Click on continue.

* Click on *Yes I trust the authors* button

. It should open a IDE type interface. Click on the image:m1/kebab.png[width=20,height=20] icon and open a *New Terminal* as shown below.
+

. Click on the bash icon and select *Rename* option. 
+

. Type *RHEL* in the box and press enter.

. In the *RHEL* terminal window, run the following command to log into the RHEL machine.
+
[source,sh,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
ssh -o ServerAliveInterval=60 -o ServerAliveCountMax=60 lab-user@{rhel_hostname}
----

. Type yes and hit enter if prompted by the message *Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/fingerprint)?*

. Enter your password `{rhel_ssh_password}` when prompted and press enter.

. You should now be logged into the RHEL machine. Let's see how we can setup a link between the database and the OpenShift cluster.

. In the *RHEL*terminal window, run the following command to create a site. Similar to our OpenShift site, this will setup the routers in the namespace.
+
[source,sh,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
export SKUPPER_PLATFORM=podman
skupper site create rhel
----

. You should see the following output.
+
[source,sh]
----
File written to /home/lab-user/.local/share/skupper/namespaces/default/input/resources/sites/rhel.yaml
----

. Next let's learn what a connector is.
+
[.concept]
.What is a connector?
****
A connector binds a local workload to listeners in remote sites. Listeners and connectors are matched using routing keys. Each connector has an associated workload and routing key. The workload can be specified as a Kubernetes pod selector or as the host and port of a local network service. The routing key is a string identifier that binds the connector to listeners in remote sites.

On Kubernetes, the workload is usually specified using a pod selector. On Docker, Podman, and Linux, it is specified using a host and port.

. In the same terminal window, run the following command to create a connector.
+
[source,sh,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
skupper connector create mysqldb 3306 --host 127.0.0.1 -r appconn
----

. You should see the following output.

. Before the final step of creating the Virtual Application Network, let's go the https://skupper-network-observer-travel-db.{}{ocp_cluster_openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/[Service Interconnect Network Console, window="network-console"] Service Interconnect Network Console to visualize the the Virtual Application Network.

. Enter the username and password if prompted. *admin/{ocp_cluster_openshift_cluster_admin_password}*

. You should only be able to see the Openshift cluster (travel-db namespace). This is because the RHEL on-prem machine is not yet part of the Virtual Application Network.
