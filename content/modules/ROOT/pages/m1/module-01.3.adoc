== Activity: Transferring secure token to RHEL

. In the *OpenShift terminal (upper terminal)*, run the following script to convert the grant to a token and transfer the token. 
+
[source,sh,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rpscodes/app_connectivity_summit25/refs/heads/main/convert_grant_token.sh | bash > summit_token.yaml && scp summit_token.yaml lab-user@{rhel_hostname}:/home/lab-user/.local/share/skupper/namespaces/default/input/resources/
----

. Type *yes* and hit enter if prompted by the message *Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/fingerprint)?*

. Ignore the *Failed to add the host to the list of known hosts (/data/.ssh/known_hosts).* message

. Enter the RHEL password `{rhel_ssh_password}` when prompted.
 
. Since the token has now been transferred to the RHEL machine, let's start the Virtual Application Network by running the below command from the *RHEL terminal(lower terminal)*.
