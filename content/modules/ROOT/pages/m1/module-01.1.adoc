== Activity: Setting up the site on OpenShift
Virtual Application Networks can be set up with Red Hat Service Interconnect by either using the command line interface or the Openshift operator. In this exercise we'll use the operator on the OpenShift cluster and the command line interface on the RHEL server to explore both methods. 

. Navigate to the {ocp_cluster_openshift_cluster_console_url}/k8s/cluster/projects/travel-db/openshift-site-plugin[OpenShift Console, window="console"] and Login as *admin/{ocp_cluster_openshift_cluster_admin_password}* if prompted.

. Make sure you are in the *Service Interconnect* tab at the top of the `travel-db` project page and click on *Create site*. This sets up the VAN routers in the namespace.

.What is a site?
****
A site represents a particular location and a particular platform. It's a place where you have real running workloads. Each site contains an application service router to communicate with local workloads and forward to peers in remote sites.

.What is a router?
****
Layer 7 application routers form the backbone of a VAN in the same way that conventional network routers form the backbone of a VPN. However, instead of routing IP packets between network endpoints, Layer 7 application routers route messages between application endpoints (called Layer 7 application addresses).
****

. Leave the default values and click on Submit. The *Enable link access* is checked indicating that this site will allow ingress connections from other sites.

. Once the site is created, you should see screen as shown in the image below.

. Once the site creation is complete. Click on the *Deploy Network Console* button to visualize to network later. This is will take few seconds to load.

. Before we proceed, let us learn what a listener is.
+
[.concept]
.What is a Listener?
****
A listener binds a local connection endpoint to connectors in remote sites. Listeners and connectors are matched using routing keys. Each listener has an associated connection endpoint and routing key. The connection endpoint exposes a host and port for accepting connections from local clients. The routing key is a string identifier that binds the listener to connectors in remote sites. On Kubernetes, a listener is implemented as a Service. On Docker, Podman, and Linux, it is a listening socket bound to a local network interface.

. Click on *Create listener*. This sets up the listeners in the namespace.

. Input the following details and click *Submit*.:
** *Name*: `mysqldb`
** *Port*: `3306`
** *Routing key*: `appconn`
** *Host*: `mysqldb`

. Next, let us learn what a Access Token is and create one.
+
[.concept]
.What is a token?
****
An access token is a short-lived credential used to create the link. An access token contains the URL and secret code of a corresponding access grant. Access tokens are issued from access grants. A grant issues zero or more tokens. Tokens are redeemed for links.
Access tokens have limited redemptions and limited lifespans. By default, they can be redeemed only once, and they expire 15 minutes after being issued. You can set custom limits by configuring the access grant.
****

. Click on *Generate a token*
+
image::m1/token_button.png[]

. Input the following details and click *Create*:
** *FileName*: `my-grant`
** *Redemptions*: `1`
** *Valid for*: `60 minutes`

. Click on *Done*. If you would like to inspect how the grant, feel feel to download and open the file. Ignore the token creation steps and as we'll use a script to convert and transfer it to our RHEL machine on-premises.
