== How to Use Claude Agents

=== Basic Usage Pattern

In Claude Code chat, use this format:
```
Act as the [agent-name] agent and [specific task]
```

=== Example Agent Requests

==== Content Creation Examples

**Technical Writer - Create Workshop Module:**
```
Act as the technical-writer agent and create Module 2 for a container security workshop targeting DevOps engineers
```

**Technical Writer - Review Structure:**
```
Use the technical-writer agent to review workshop/example/ and ensure it follows proper workshop structure with clear learning objectives
```

**Researcher - Validate Content:**
```
Act as the researcher agent and verify the technical accuracy of the OpenShift commands in workshop/example/05-module-03.adoc
```

==== Quality Assurance Examples

**Workshop Reviewer - Full Validation:**
```
Use the workshop-reviewer agent to perform a comprehensive review of workshop/templates/ against Red Hat quality standards
```

**Style Enforcer - Corporate Compliance:**
```
Act as the style-enforcer agent and check workshop/example/01-overview.adoc for Red Hat corporate style compliance
```

**Technical Editor - Polish Content:**
```
Apply the technical-editor agent to improve the clarity and formatting of workshop/example/03-module-01.adoc
```

**Accessibility Checker - Inclusive Design:**
```
Use the accessibility-checker agent to review workshop/templates/ for WCAG compliance and inclusive design
```

==== Red Hat Style and Citation Examples

**Style Guide Compliance Check:**
```
Act as the style-enforcer agent and validate this content follows Red Hat corporate style:
- Headlines use sentence case
- Product names follow official Red Hat naming
- Numbers are written as numerals
- Oxford commas are used consistently
```

**Citation and Claims Validation:**
```
Use the style-enforcer agent to check for unsupported claims in workshop/example/01-overview.adoc and ensure any superlatives like "best," "leading," or "most" include proper citations
```

**Inclusive Language Review:**
```
Apply the style-enforcer agent to scan workshop/templates/ for non-inclusive terms and replace with Red Hat approved alternatives (e.g., allowlist/denylist instead of whitelist/blacklist)
```

==== Multi-Agent Workflows

**Complete Workshop Development:**
```
1. Act as the technical-writer agent and create a new workshop module on Kubernetes networking
2. Use the researcher agent to validate all technical commands and procedures
3. Apply the workshop-reviewer agent to check learning progression and exercise structure
4. Use the style-enforcer agent to ensure Red Hat corporate style compliance
5. Apply the accessibility-checker agent to verify inclusive design principles
```

**Demo Content Conversion:**
```
1. Act as the technical-writer agent and convert workshop/example/ to demo format using Know/Show structure
2. Use the researcher agent to add current business value metrics and use cases
3. Apply the style-enforcer agent for final Red Hat style validation
```

=== File-Specific Agent Requests

**Review Specific Files:**
```
Act as the workshop-reviewer agent and validate content/modules/ROOT/pages/workshop/example/03-module-01.adoc
```

**Check Multiple Files:**
```
Use the style-enforcer agent to check all files in workshop/templates/ for Red Hat style compliance
```

**Compare Content:**
```
Act as the technical-editor agent and compare workshop/example/ with workshop/templates/ for consistency
```

== Agent Integration with Verification System

The agents automatically use verification prompts from the showroom-content-wizard repository:

=== Workshop Verification Prompts
- `enhanced_verification_workshop.txt`: Comprehensive workshop validation
- `verify_workshop_structure.txt`: Workshop structure and pedagogy
- `verify_technical_accuracy_workshop.txt`: Technical command verification

=== Demo Verification Prompts
- `enhanced_verification_demo.txt`: Demo content validation
- `verify_demo_structure.txt`: Know/Show structure verification
- `verify_technical_accuracy_demo.txt`: Demo technical accuracy

=== Style and Accessibility Prompts
- `redhat_style_guide_validation.txt`: Corporate style compliance
- `verify_accessibility_compliance_workshop.txt`: Workshop accessibility
- `verify_content_quality.txt`: General content quality

== Workshop vs Demo Structure

=== Workshop Structure (Hands-on Learning)
```
= Module Title
== Learning objectives
== Background concepts
== Exercise 1: Hands-on activity
=== Prerequisites
=== Steps
=== Expected results
=== Troubleshooting
== Exercise 2: Advanced activity
== Module summary
```

=== Demo Structure (Presenter Guidance)
```
= Demo Module Title
== Part 1 — Topic
=== Know (Business context, value proposition)
=== Show (Step-by-step demonstration)
== Part 2 — Advanced Topic
=== Know (Technical background)
=== Show (Advanced demonstration)
```

```

== Best Practices

=== Agent Usage Tips
- **Be specific**: Include file paths and exact requirements
- **Use progressive refinement**: Start with one agent, then apply others
- **Combine agents**: Use multiple agents for comprehensive quality assurance
- **Iterate**: Apply the same agent multiple times as content improves

=== Content Development Workflow
1. **Create**: Use technical-writer agent for initial content
2. **Research**: Apply researcher agent for technical validation
3. **Review**: Use workshop-reviewer agent for structure validation
4. **Style**: Apply style-enforcer agent for Red Hat compliance
5. **Polish**: Use technical-editor agent for final improvements
6. **Accessibility**: Apply accessibility-checker agent for inclusive design

=== Quality Assurance Checklist
- [ ] Learning objectives are clear and measurable
- [ ] Exercises include proper validation steps
- [ ] Technical commands are accurate and tested
- [ ] Red Hat corporate style is followed
- [ ] Content is accessible and inclusive
- [ ] Images have descriptive alt text
- [ ] Code blocks specify language for syntax highlighting

== Troubleshooting

=== Common Issues

**Agent doesn't understand the request:**
- Be more specific about the task and files involved
- Include the full file path from repository root

**Agent provides generic feedback:**
- Reference specific agent configuration file
- Ask for actionable recommendations with before/after examples

**Multiple agents give conflicting advice:**
- Apply agents in sequence (content → structure → style → accessibility)
- Use workshop-reviewer agent to reconcile conflicts

=== Getting Help

**View agent configuration:**
```
Show me the content of .claude/agents/technical-writer.md
```

**Understand agent capabilities:**
```
Explain what the workshop-reviewer agent can do and how it differs from the technical-editor agent
```

**Agent debugging:**
```
Act as the workshop-reviewer agent and explain your evaluation criteria for workshop/example/03-module-01.adoc
```
