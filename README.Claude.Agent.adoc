In Claude Code chat, use this format:
```
Act as the [agent-name] agent and [specific task]
```

=== Example Agent Requests

==== Content Creation Examples

**Technical Writer - Create Workshop Module:**
```
Act as the technical-writer agent and create Module 2 for a container security workshop targeting DevOps engineers following progressive skill building and Red Hat corporate style standards
```

**Technical Writer - Review Structure:**
```
Use the technical-writer agent to review workshop/example/ and ensure it follows progressive skill building with clear learning objectives and proper pedagogical flow
```

**Researcher - Validate Content:**
```
Act as the researcher agent and verify the technical accuracy and current version compatibility of the OpenShift commands in workshop/example/05-module-03.adoc
```

==== Quality Assurance Examples

**Workshop Reviewer - Full Validation:**
```
Use the workshop-reviewer agent to perform a comprehensive review of workshop/templates/ against Red Hat quality standards, focusing on learning objectives, exercise structure, and technical accuracy
```

**Style Enforcer - Corporate Compliance:**
```
Act as the style-enforcer agent and check workshop/example/01-overview.adoc for Red Hat corporate style compliance, including headline capitalization, product naming, and inclusive language
```

**Technical Editor - Polish Content:**
```
Apply the technical-editor agent to improve the clarity, formatting, and technical accuracy of workshop/example/03-module-01.adoc
```

**Accessibility Checker - Inclusive Design:**
```

Use the style-enforcer agent to check for unsupported claims in workshop/example/01-overview.adoc and ensure any superlatives like "best," "leading," or "most" include proper citations or quantifiable metrics
```

**Inclusive Language Review:**
```
Apply the style-enforcer agent to scan workshop/templates/ for non-inclusive terms and replace with Red Hat approved alternatives (allowlist/denylist instead of whitelist/blacklist, primary/secondary instead of master/slave)
```

==== Multi-Agent Workflows

**Complete Workshop Development:**

```

== Agent Integration with Verification System

The agents automatically use verification prompts from the showroom-content-wizard repository:

=== Workshop Verification Prompts
- `enhanced_verification_workshop.txt`: Comprehensive workshop validation
- `verify_workshop_structure.txt`: Workshop structure and pedagogy
- `verify_technical_accuracy_workshop.txt`: Technical command verification

=== Workshop Enhancement Prompts
- `enhanced_verification_storytelling.txt`: Narrative engagement validation
- `verify_business_context.txt`: Business scenario authenticity
- `verify_emotional_journey.txt`: Personal protagonist arc validation

=== Style and Accessibility Prompts

== Troubleshooting

=== Common Issues

**Agent doesn't understand the request:**
- Be more specific about the task and files involved
- Include the full file path from repository root

**Agent provides generic feedback:**
- Reference specific agent configuration file
- Ask for actionable recommendations with before/after examples

**Multiple agents give conflicting advice:**
- Apply agents in sequence (content → structure → style → accessibility)
- Use workshop-reviewer agent to reconcile conflicts

=== Getting Help

**View agent configuration:**
```
Show me the content of .claude/agents/technical-writer.md
```

**Understand agent capabilities:**
```
Explain what the workshop-reviewer agent can do and how it differs from the technical-editor agent
```

**Agent debugging:**
```
Act as the workshop-reviewer agent and explain your evaluation criteria for workshop/example/03-module-01.adoc
```
